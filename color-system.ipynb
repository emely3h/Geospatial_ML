    "HSV stands for hue, saturation, and value.\n",
    "Hue represents the colour and has a value between 0 and 359 (e.g., 0= red and 226=blue).\n",
    "Saturation shows the amount of white light mixed with a hue. Saturation is a percentage(e.g., 0%= you can clearly see the hue's colour and 100%= you cannot see anything).\n",
    "Value is brightness, which is also a percentage(e.g., 0%=dark and 100%=hue's colour).\n",
    "\n",
    "To convert RGB format into HSV format, OpenCV is usually used. In OpenCV, the hue channel is reduced up to 180. Saturation and value are between 0 and 250. Therefore, the converted image will have different colours if you try to convert the RGB format into HSV with OpenCV(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39129403/hsv-image-different-from-rgb-image).\n"
